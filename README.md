Unit 2 Assignment - The VBA of Wall Street <br />
This is a revision from what I submitted on 1/21/19.
The attached code accomplishes the Easy, Moderate, Hard, and Challenge parts of the assignment in a single macro. <br />
The .vbs file ending with v1 uses new concepts over the past week.  The v2 file utilizes 'while' loops rather than 'for-next' loops.  There are other significant differences as well.<br />
I have attached three screenshots for the results of years 2014, 2015, and 2016. Both .vbs code files yield identical results.<br />
-CDR.
